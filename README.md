# Welcome to Honeydo!

This is designed to be a lightweight project with the main goal of fleshing out the *@sign* ecosystem.

# Function

*HoneyDo* is a to-do list app meant to be dead simple to use, but able to be expanded with additional basic features easily.

## Installing

You can download the latest apk from the releases tab on the right of repository. Download directly to your android device, and simply run the apk! Note that most if not all all manufacturers will include multiple safeguards to prevent malicious installations, so you may need to click through several persmissions windows.

# Use

The app is designed to be as user friendly as possible and fast to use

## Storage

The first thing you will be greeted with is the storage selection. For now you can only select local storage but there was code to integrate into *@sign's* server for cloud storage and collaborative features.

## DoLists

You will then find yourself presented with 2 sample lists to explore functionality before you start using the app. On this page there are three possible actions, create or delete a list, or view an existing one. To create, tap the **New List** button you will immediately be sent to the taskpage to work on your list. To delete a list, long press a list and it will prompt for confirmation before deleting the list. Regular tap any list to view it in the taskpage.

## Tasks

At the top of the taskpage you should see a title, if you are making a new list a name will be generated for you. You can change this at anytime by tapping the title and typing whatever name you please. The enter button on your keyboard will confirm the change. To add a task to your list there will be a field under title with a *what would you like to do* prompt. Like the title field, simply type in your task and press enter to confirm it, and it will immediately appear at the buttom of the list. when a task is complete simply tap it to check it off! Should you decide that you dont want a completed task in your list or for any other reason, swipe a task to the left and it will disappear. Note that it will not prompt you for confirmation so be careful where you swipe.

# This is a work in progress/prototype

This app was designed quickly and with expansion in mind, while it shouldn't be buggy it is not as feature rich as a Google app. Some potential future features could be:

- @sign login
> This was the original goal but for many reasons there were too many issues with getting the login to work
- Due dates
>Show how long you have until a task should be completed
- Collaboration
>This was another original goal in mind but was impossible to complete without the cloud storage and an account system working.
